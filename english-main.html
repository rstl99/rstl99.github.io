<h2>1. This is a Powerpoint presentation I prepared and gave in Fall 2019 to our local NAWCC Chapter 111.  During the pandemic, it was borrowed and used in a zoom meeting of one of the Antiquarian Horology Society's sections, in the UK. The presentation provides an overview of provincial watch and clock making in Colchester, Essex, England, during the period 1710-1850. It focuses on the lives and works of 4 makers:  John Smorthwait (1675-1739), Nathaniel Hedge 3 (1710-1795), Nathaniel Hedge 4 (1735-1821), and Joseph Banister (1778-1875).</h2>
