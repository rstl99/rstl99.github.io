<h2>Below are links to documents I have written related to English Antique Horology <i>(More content to come shortly)</i></h3>
<h2>1. An overview of provincial watch and clock making in <i>Colchester, Essex, England</i>, during the period 1710-1850.  This is a Powerpoint presentation I prepared and gave in Fall 2019 to our local NAWCC Chapter 111.  During the pandemic, it was borrowed and used in a zoom meeting of one of the Antiquarian Horology Society's sections, in the UK. It focuses on the lives and works of 4 makers:  John Smorthwait (1675-1739), Nathaniel Hedge 3 (1710-1795), Nathaniel Hedge 4 (1735-1821), and Joseph Banister (1778-1875).</h2>

<h3>“We clock enthusiasts tend to become bogged down in the details of the clocks, their style, age, fine engraving, unusual escapements. We tend to forget that the maker was not a clock-making machine, but a real person often with far more of a burden in the form of the stresses and worries of life than we experience ourselves.” - Brian Loomes, writing about John Smorthwaite.</h3>
