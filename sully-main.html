<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>In Southern England in 1728, there were six consecutive days of fog in September.  The winter there would be severe, with snow from mid-December to the end of January.  In France, the winter was said to have been one of the harshest ones in several years.  On possibly a cold day in mid-October, an older English clockmaker spent several hours unsuccessfully – he had been given the wrong address – looking for someone in the large neighborhood of St. Marceau, in Paris.  By the time he got home to his wife and five children (a daughter aged 21, two late teenagers, and a couple of younger children), he was chilled to the bone and starting to feel ill. </p>
<p>Possibly, he had not been feeling well for some time, and the long walk in the cold forced him to bed, where he quickly got progressively worse.  By the time a doctor was called for a few days later, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and not given long to live.  The parish priest of St. Sulpice, where the old clockmaker had, only a few days before, been working on the meridian line that he had been tasked to install, sat to comfort the ailing man and eventually convinced him to convert to Catholicism, which would allow him to be buried with proper honours in his church.</p>
<p>As he lay in bed, surrounded by his family, labouring for breath and feeling energies slip away from him, the clockmaker looked back on his life, so full of interesting events and famous people met and befriended.  He had failed at some of his more ambitious initiatives, but had made valiant attempts to advance the art of horology at a critical juncture of this discipline, especially in France, where he had spent most of his adult life.  A few friends came to visit and wish him well, including one of the most famous Parisian watchmakers, who later told the story of his friend’s death, which he said came only four or five days after the ill-fated walk in St. Marceau.</p>
<p>Three months later, a Parisian woman wrote to her brother, at the time working in St. Petersburg, to inform him of the passing of the clockmaker, with whom he had been acquainted.  She said it was felt that the grief of being pursued by creditors was the cause of his death, which had left his wife and five children “in extreme misery”.  But she added that the parish priest “looked after them all”.</p>  
<p>This is the story of Henry Sully, this English clockmaker, as best can be determined from his published works, writings of some of his contemporaries, and extensive research in online archives and in various periodicals and books that have mentioned him over the ensuing three centuries.  Though it ended prematurely and sadly, there is much to celebrate and venerate about Sully’s amazing life journey. I wrote and will publish this monograph online in different chapters, in an attempt to more fully describe his life than ever has before.</p>
