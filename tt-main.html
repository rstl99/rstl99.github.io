<p>This updated website (first developed in January 2020), and is dedicated to my hobby and passion, antique horology. In it you will find information pertaining to my explorations and research into the intricate and detailed aspects of watchmakers, clockmakers, and their timepieces. My current interests primarily focus on French/Parisian horologists from the eighteenth century, so many of the articles relate to this small part of the history of global horology. However, I have written some articles dealing with English horology, and other subjects. Some texts are in English, others in French, and others yet in a combination of the two, depending on the subjects and sources quoted. In many cases, I have offered my own translation of French texts not previously available in English.</p>
<p>I will also publish articles that I have written on horology (viewable in PDF format), and future articles or works in progress. Also, I will share with you some detailed photos taken during disassembly and inspection of some of the antique watches and clocks in my collection.</p> 
<p>Hopefully you will enjoy spending a bit of time browsing my site, and please leave comments on what you see, which will help me improve the content over time.</p>
