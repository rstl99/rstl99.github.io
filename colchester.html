<title>Colchester Makers 1710-1850</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a Powerpoint presentation I prepared and gave in Fall 2019 to our local NAWCC Chapter 111.  During the pandemic, it was borrowed and used in a zoom meeting of one of the Antiquarian Horology Society&#8217;s sections, in the UK.</p>

<p>The presentation provides an overview of provincial watch and clock making in Colchester, Essex, England, during the period 1710-1850.</p>

<p>It focuses on the lives and works of 4 makers:  John Smorthwait (1675-1739), Nathaniel Hedge 3 (1710-1795), Nathaniel Hedge 4 (1735-1821), and Joseph Banister (1778-1875).</p>
