<h1>Hello and welcome to Timetales.ca</h1><br>
<h2>This site is being reconstructed and will be available soon to provide you quality custom content on antique horology, including:</h2>
<h3><p> - <b>Henry Sully Pages</b> (detailed biography, and much extra information on this great but forgotten horologist)</p>
<p> - Various articles on <b>French and English antique horology</b> (Julien Le Roy, Colchester makers, etc.)</p></h3>

<h2><p>Please come back to see the streamlined new site which will make it easier to read and download the articles I have written.</p>

<p>Thank you and see you soon!</p></h2>
