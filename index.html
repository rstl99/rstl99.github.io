Hello and welcome to Timetales.ca
This site is being reconstructed and will be available soon to provide you quality custom content on antique horology, including:

Henry Sully Pages (detailed biography, and much extra information on this great but forgotten horologist)
Various articles on French and English antique horology (Julien Le Roy, Colchester makers, etc.)
Please come back to see the streamlined new site which will make it easier to read and download the articles I have written.

Thank you and see you soon!
