<h1>Hello and welcome to Timetales.ca</h1><br>
<h3>This site is being reconstructed and will be available soon to provide you quality custom content on antique horology, including:</h3><br>

 <h4>Henry Sully Pages (detailed biography, and much extra information on this great but forgotten horologist)<br>
 Various articles on French and English antique horology (Julien Le Roy, Colchester makers, etc.)<br></h4>

<h3>Please come back to see the streamlined new site which will make it easier to read and download the articles I have written.</h3><br>

Thank you and see you soon!<br>
