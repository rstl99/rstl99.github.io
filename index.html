<p><H1></H1>Hello and welcome to Timetales.ca</p><br>
<p>This site is being reconstructed and will be available soon to provide you quality custom content on antique horology, including:</p><br>

<p>Henry Sully Pages (detailed biography, and much extra information on this great but forgotten horologist)</p><br>
<p>Various articles on French and English antique horology (Julien Le Roy, Colchester makers, etc.)</p><br>
<p>Please come back to see the streamlined new site which will make it easier to read and download the articles I have written.</p><br>

<p>Thank you and see you soon!</p><br>
