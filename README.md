# Hello and welcome to Timetales.ca

This site is being reconstructed and will be available soon to provide you **quality custom content** on antique horology, including:
  - **Henry Sully Pages** (detailed biography, and much extra information on this great but forgotten horologist)
  - Various articles on **French and English** antique horology (Julien Le Roy, Colchester makers, etc.)

Please come back to see the streamlined new site which will make it **easier to read and download** the articles I have written.

Thank you and see you *soon*!

(Robert St-Louis, Ottawa, Canada)
